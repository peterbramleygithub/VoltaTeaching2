 <h1 class="w3-center">Policies and guidelines</h1>
  <p class="w3-center"></br></br>
 Prior to participating in learning, please refer to the following policies and guidelines which can be found on our website:
<ul>
<li>Data protection Policy</li>
<li>E-safety and Online learning Policy</li>
<li>Safeguarding & Child Protection Policy </li>
<li>Cancellation Policy</li>
</ul>
</p>
  <p class="w3-left"></br></br>

<h2>Data protection policy</h2>
At Volta Teaching, we believe privacy is important. We are committed to complying with data protection obligations and to being concise, clear and transparent about how we obtain and use Personal Information.</br></br>

The types of personal data that we may handle include, without limitation, details of pupils and parents or guardians including: individuals’ age, attending school, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses. All data and personal information is stored confidentially and securely in electronic form in password protected areas. </br></br>

Volta Teaching will only use any personal information you provide about you or your child to administer your account and provide the services you have requested from us or opted in to for marketing purposes. </br></br>

If you wish for your personal details to be deleted from records, please email voltateaching@gmail.com Please note that deletion is only possible if all invoices are settled and there is no outstanding balance on your account.</br></br>

<h2>E-Safety and Online learning policy</h2>
Safeguarding is just as important when communicating or teaching online as it is when teaching face-to-face. 
Teachers, parents/carers and pupils must follow the following code of conduct: </br>

<ul>
<li>Student email addresses or numbers will only be used for students to access sessions, to notify of absence or lateness or for teachers to send session resources to be viewed.</li>
<li>When communicating online, observe the same rules of behaviour as if speaking with them in person by being professional, polite and respectful.</li>
</ul>

Online Learning is the primary delivery of tutoring sessions. Volta teaching has chosen Skype as the online learning platform that satisfies the needs of teacher and pupils. Accessed via a personalised meeting link for every student and can be used in line with our safeguarding policy. Where skype is not accessible, online lessons may use FaceTime as another platform.
The following code of conduct is in place to ensure that Online Learning is conducted in an effective and safe way. </br></br>




<h2>Online Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only agree lessons at times mutually agreed by the teacher and parent/carer.</li>
<li>Begin the initial trial lesson with parent and student to virtually meet the teacher. After this point and for subsequent sessions, parents should use their own discretion whether to remain with pupils.</li>
<li>Conduct the lesson in a public setting in a common use area in the house, not in a pupils bedroom.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately and take care that the frame is well chosen with a neutral background not giving away where they live.</li>
<li>Protect themselves from accidental inappropriate digital contact with pupils by restricting their profile so that it does not automatically accept contact requests and is not accessible to others.</li>
<li>Use an appropriate profile picture and establish a professional, respectful manner when using their chosen online platform </li>
<li>Ensure that the chosen online learning platform is not used for any other contact, eg. sharing photos or general messaging</li>
<li>Not make recordings of lessons</li>
<li>If the teacher is uncomfortable with the way the lesson is progressing, they will terminate the lesson. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Safeguarding and child protection policy</h2>

We recognise that the welfare of children is paramount and all children regardless of age, disability, gender, racial heritage, religious belief, sexual orientation or identity, have an equal right to protection from all types of harm and abuse.</br></br>

We have a responsibility to promote the welfare of all children and young people and to keep them safe. We are committed to practise in a way that protects them. Working in partnership with children, young people, carer’s and other agencies is essential in promoting young peoples’ welfare.</br></br>

We will seek to keep children and young people safe by:
<ul>
<li>Valuing them, listening to them and respecting them</li>
<li>Give enthusiastic and constructive feedback rather than negative criticism.</li>
<li>Implementing effective online learning policy and procedures </li>
<li>Ensuring teachers are DBS checked</li>
<li>Recording and storing information professionally and securely</li>
<li>Appropriately responding to and sharing concerns and relevant information with agencies that need to know, and involving children, young people, parents, families and carers appropriately</li>
<li>Ensuring that we provide a safe physical environment for children by applying health and safety measures in accordance with the law and regulatory guidance. </li>
<li>Recognise the individual needs of the child e.g. recognising when a child may be tired and need a break.</li>
<li>Not encourage physical contact and only use touch when it is necessary in relation to the activity. Explain and then seek the agreement of the child prior to initiating any physical contact with them if it is necessary.</li>
<li>If participants initiate touch themselves, such as a hug, managing this carefully and appropriately. </li>
</ul>



<h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
If prior to payment at the beginning of the half term there is a date you cannot do, I can remove this from the payment total or reschedule in advance. If once the half term has commenced, there is a reason you cannot make the session please notify me 24 hours in advance and we will aim to reschedule subject to availability. 
Lessons will continue every half term until written notice to discontinue is received.</br></br>
<u>If the pupil misses a lesson</u></br>
If a lesson is offered but has been missed because the pupil has been absent or unavailable and 24 hours notice has not been provided, this will not be rescheduled. For online sessions, the teacher will stay on the call for 10 minutes for an answer. </br></br>
<u>If the teacher misses a lesson</u></br>
If the teacher is unable to make a lesson due to illness or unforeseen circumstances, every effort will be made to reschedule. If rescheduling is not possible, the session payment will carry into the next half term and reduce the upfront payment.
