  Private tutoring and Performing Arts teaching based in West Sussex. Ran by Vicky Bramley. </br>

Tutoring in: <b>English, Maths, Science and Drama</b> either in person or virtually for <b>Primary, KS3, GCSE or A Levels/ BTECs</b> as well as those wishing to further their knowledge in subject areas.</br></br>
Providing Performing Arts private 1-1 and group lessons and workshops in <b>Singing, Acting, Dance and Musical Theatre</b>.</br>

  <p class="w3-center"><em>Why Volta?</em></br></br>

A 'Volta' is a poetic device in English which represents a turn in thought, or a change in idea. I decided to incorporate this into by business name as I believe private tutoring and teaching can be a pivotal step into the success of a student (be it through weekly classes or workshops) and hopefully create a 'Volta' towards the desired exam results.</p>

     <p class="w3-center"> I offer tutoring sessions for homework help, mock and exam preparation, and general tuition. Following the National curriculum syllabus and exam board specifications, I ensure that your child receives the most tailored teaching for their individual success.</br></br>



Sessions are an hour long either once or twice weekly, whenever is best suited to you. I align my sessions with the student's school term dates with the option for half term and holiday sessions to bridge the gaps of learning breaks. Currently sessions are ran virtually due to their success during the pandemic. Students access their session via Skype or Facetime and all resources are sent via email for access on their device and shared on screen.</br></br>

Payments are made via bank transfer or standing order paid every half term in advance. Students may attend one trial session at the same hourly rate before committing to a half term payment. Please see below for the pricing details. I also offer one-off sessions to focus on a particular areas of weakness if the student does not need a full half term of sessions but just a little bit of help.</p>

<p><h3>MY PERFORMING AND TEACHING EXPERIENCE</h3>
  <!-- Responsive Grid. Four columns on tablets, laptops and desktops. Will stack on mobile devices/small screens (100% width) -->
  <div class="w3-row-padding w3-center">
     <p class="w3-center">I have always loved musical theatre and took part in a variety of dance, singing and acting classes from a young age and performed regularly at local theatres and in school productions. I learned the RAD (Royal Academy of Dance) ballet syllabus as a child and sat exams in ISTD (Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance) Classical Ballet and Musical Theatre singing with London College of Music.</br></br>
I am a singing teacher for students aged 4-18 in Saturday performing arts classes focussing on musical theatre and commercial pop. I frequently plan and deliver both bi- weekly, weekly and one off workshops and sessions for primary and secondary pupils in musical theatre skills. Exploring and developing the techniques of acting, singing and dance in a fun and engaging way whilst often preparing for end of term performances.</br></br>
I coach vocal and physical warmups to train aural and kinaesthetic skills before teaching dynamic dances and songs with prepared vocal parts and harmonies. I adapt the difficulty levels appropriately to accommodate their differing ages, needs and ability with a fun approach. I have also partaken work experience in local theatres, classroom assisting in a local primary school, and a reading mentor for younger students.</br></br>
I have also had a variety of other roles in the performing arts industry ranging from creative and production team roles such as assistant director, stage management assistance and costume and prop designing and chaperoning. I have also partaken in a work experience week for the LEAP (Learning, Education and participation) team at Chichester festival theatre.</p>

      <p>My name is Victoria Bramley and I am passionate about education and ensuring that all students can have the right tools they need to succeed in school and therefore later life. I started the Volta teaching business in 2019 and since then, I have taught children and young people from ages 3-19. I have an up to date DBS check and clean UK driving license. </br></br>

I ensure my sessions create a nurturing environment for students to challenge themselves to reach their full potential. I have always loved teaching and setting up my tutoring and teaching business has been the best decision. Being able to see students improving, growing in confidence and succeeding in exams is worth every hour spent lesson planning!</br></br>
